          <p> Banto and Santo inherited a Precious plant garden from their uncle
            Manto. The Precious plant is a very strange plant. It is one-dimensional,
            the only dimension being its height. Viewed from above it looks like a point.
            The garden is a square 50 by 50 meters. It has to be split into two parts.
            Santo (as he is very lazy) does not want to do the work so he told Banto:
            "Just split the garden, but make sure that my part is a square with its sides
            parallel to the sides of the original garden and that it contains at least
            half of the Precious plant trees." Banto agreed to do this but he added one
            condition: Santo's part must have the smallest area possible. </p>

          <p> Banto measured positions of all Precious plant trees in the garden
            and typed them into the computer. Now he is trying to determine the smallest
            square that contains at least half of the Precious plant trees. A plant is
            contained in a square if it is inside it or on its border. It is not an easy
            problem. Go! Help him! </p>

          <h3>Input file specification</h3>

          <p> The input file contains the number of Precious plant trees on the
            first line. Each of the following lines contains two numbers specifying the
            position of a Precious plant. Coordinates are measured from the south-west
            corner of the garden, parallel to its sides, in meters, with infinite precision.
            All numbers in the file are distinct (this comes from a rule about growing
            Precious plants that we will not explain here). </p>

          <h3>Output file specification</h3>

          <p> The output file should contain two lines with two numbers each:
            coordinates of arbitrary two opposing corners of the minimal square containing
            at least half of the Precious plant trees. </p>

          <h3>Example</h3>
          <b>Input file:</b>
          <pre>4<br>1.23 4.14<br>6.02 3<br>5 6<br>10 4.5<br></pre>
          <b>Output file:</b> (out of several possibilities)
          <pre>4 3<br>7 6<br></pre>
