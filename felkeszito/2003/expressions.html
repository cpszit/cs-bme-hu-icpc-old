      <p>Little Michael got a really interesting present last Christmas. It
was a box full of colorful tiles with fancy symbols. After a closer inspection,
Michael found out that there were several types  of tiles. There were red
tiles displaying symbols "<b>+</b>", "<b>*</b>", "<b>!</b>", green tiles
with symbols "<b>(</b>" and "<b>)</b>", and a few blue tiles with large symbols 
"<b>1</b>" across their faces. </p>
  
      <p> Michael soon realized that red tiles represented mathematical operations:
 <b>+</b> stood for addition, <b>*</b> for multiplication, <b>!</b> for the
factorial function. (The factorial of a positive integer <b>n</b> is defined
as the product of all positive integers less than or equal to <b>n</b>, i.e. 
      <b>n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...2.1</b>.) Green tiles certainly represented left
and right parentheses. But why were there only a few blue tiles and each
of them had a <b>1</b> on its top?  </p>
  
      <p> The brochure he found in the box after taking all the tiles out
said  that the game was named "<i>Express your number</i>".  It claimed that
the game is a great companion  for his free time and is good for players
of all skills and ages. It went further explaining that the point of the
game is to find an expression consisting of additions, multiplications,  factorials,
parentheses and numbers <b>1</b> that would evaluate to a given number <b>n</b>. 
The brochure also contained a list of sample numbers and encouraged him to 
find expressions for them. Michael soon realized that since there were only
a few blue tiles, he had to find expressions that would not contain too many
      <b>1</b>s. Now he is trying to express every number by an expression
that contains as few <b>1</b>s as possible. </p>
  Formally,  
      <ol>
 <li> <b>1</b> is an expression. </li>
        <li> If <b>e</b> is an expression then         <b>(e)</b> and <b>e<tt>!</tt></b>
are expressions. </li>
        <li> If <b>e<sub>1</sub></b> and <b>e<sub>2</sub></b> are expressions
then  <b>e<sub>1</sub><tt>+</tt>e<sub>2</sub></b> and <b>e<sub>1</sub><tt>*</tt>e<sub>2</sub></b>
are expressions. </li>
        <li> Nothing else is considered to be an expression. </li>
      </ol>
  Expressions are evaluated using standard precedence rules (i.e. <tt>!</tt>
has the highest priority, followed by <tt>*</tt> with a lower priority and
      <tt>+</tt> with the lowest priority). Note that it is not possible
to obtain a number by concatenating digits, i.e. <b>11</b> is not a valid
expression.  
      <h3>Input file specification</h3>
  
      <p> The input file contains a list of positive integers, one per line. 
The list is terminated by the number <tt>-1</tt>, which should not be processed.
 </p>
  
      <h3>Output file specification</h3>
  
      <p> Express each number in the input file by an expression that contains 
the minimum number of <b>1</b>s. If there are multiple such expressions, output
an arbitrary one of them. For technical reasons, we allow only expressions
that consist of <b>no more than 10000 symbols</b>.  Output an empty line
after each expression. You can delimit characters in your expression by spaces
and divide your expression into multiple lines. Do not insert any blank lines
inside expressions! </p>
  
      <h3>Example</h3>
  <b>Input file:</b> 
      <pre>18<br>5040<br>11<br>-1<br></pre>
  <b>Output file:</b> (out of several possibilities) 
      <pre>(1+1+1)*(1+1+1)!<br><br>((1+1+1)!+1)!<br><br>((1+1+1+1)+1)*(1+1)+1<br><br></pre>
