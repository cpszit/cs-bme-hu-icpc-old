  <h2> Dining Diplomats</h2>
  You have been hired to arrange the seating of diplomats at a dinner
  party. Your employer has invited 9 diplomats from several countries around
  the world. Each diplomat will speak from one to five languages. Diplomats
  not speaking a common language can not talk to each other. Furthermore, some
  of the countries represented will not have diplomatic relations with other
  nations represented, so these diplomats will not be speaking to each other
  either. Your task is to determine the seating arrangement at the dinner
  table for your employer and the 9 guests such that each person can speak
  to the person seated on each side. <br>
  <br>
  The table to be used for dinner is round, and seats 10 people. Your
  employer will be seated at the first position at the table. The other positions
  will be numbered clockwise from 2 to 10. The person seated to the left
  of your employer is in seat number 2, the person seated to the right of
  your employer is in seat number 10. <br>
  <br>
  Persons seated next to each other must speak a common language. A person
  may speak to the person on the left in one common language, and speak
  to the person on the right in another language. The governments of the
  guests seated next to each other must have formally recognized each other.
  <br>
  <br>
  The government of your employer has diplomatic relations with the governments
  of all of his guests. The government of a guest may or may not have diplomatic
  relations with the governments of all the other guests. <br>
  <br>
  Two diplomats from the same country will have diplomatic relations
  with the same list of countries. A country will always have diplomatic
  relations with itself. Diplomats from the same country may or may not speak
  any languages in common. <br>
  <br>
  Input to the program will be a list of ten people, one per line, ended
  by end-of-file. The first line will represent your employer, the other
  lines will represent the guest diplomats. Each line consists of a sequence
  of words, where words are separated by a single space. Each word is a sequence
  of capitals. The first word consists of 3 characters and represents the
  code for the guest's country. The second word contains 1 to 5 characters
  and represents the languages that the guest speaks. Each language that the
  guest speaks is represented by a single letter. Finally, thereis a list of
  up to 9 three-character words representing the codes of the countries of
  the other guests that this guest's government has diplomatic relations with.
  <br>
  <br>
  Output of the program is a table of the seating arrangement. It contains
  one diplomat per line. Each line starts with the seat number followed
  by three words, all separated by single spaces. The first word is the language
  code for the person seated on the left. The second word is the country
  code for the diplomat. The third word is the language code for the person
  seated on the right. The seating arrangement should be printed in the order
  1 to 10, and no blank line should appear after line 10. More than one solution
  may exist, but you need find only one. If no solution is found, output
  the sentence
  <pre>NO SOLUTION EXISTS</pre>
