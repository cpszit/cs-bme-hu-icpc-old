<h2 align="center">Piggy-Bank</h2>
<p align="center">(<b>file name:</b><code> pig.c, pig.p, pig.C</code>)  </p>

<p align="left"> Before ACM can do anything, a&nbsp;budget must be prepared
and the necessary financial support obtained. The main income for this action
comes from Irreversibly Bound Money (IBM). The idea behind is simple. Whenever 
some ACM member has any small money, he takes all the coins and throws them 
into a piggy-bank. You know that this process is irreversible, the coins cannot
be removed without breaking the pig. After a sufficiently long time, there
should be enough cash in the piggy-bank to pay everything that needs to be
paid.  </p>
<p align="left"> But there is a big problem with piggy-banks. It is not possible
to determine how much money is inside. So we might break the pig into pieces
only to find out that there is not enough money.  Clearly, we want to avoid
this unpleasant situation. The only possibility is to weigh the piggy-bank
and try to guess how many coins are inside. Assume that we are able to determine
the weight of the pig exactly and that we know the weights of all coins of
a given currency. Then there is some minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank
that we can guarantee. Your task is to find out this worst case and determine
the minimum amount of cash inside the piggy-bank. We need your help. No more
prematurely broken pigs!   </p>
<h3 align="left">Input Specification</h3>
<div align="left">  The input consists of <var>T</var> test cases. The number
of them (<var>T</var>) is given on the first line of the input file. Each
test case begins with a line containing two integers <var>E</var> and <var>
F</var>. They indicate the weight of an empty pig and of the pig filled with
coins. Both weights are given in grams. No pig will weigh more than 10 kg,
that means <var>1 &lt;= E &lt;= F &lt;= 10000</var>. On the second line of
each test case, there is an integer number <var>N</var> (<var>1 &lt;= N &lt;=
500</var>) that gives the number of various coins used in the given currency.
Following this are exactly <var>N</var> lines, each specifying one coin type.
These lines contain two integers each, <var>P</var>and <var>W</var> (<var>
1 &lt;= P &lt;= 50000</var>, <var>1 &lt;= W &lt;=10000</var>). <var>P</var>
 is the value of the coin in monetary units, <var>W</var> is it's weight
in grams.   </div>
<h3 align="left">Output Specification</h3>
<div align="left">  Print exactly one line of output for each test case.
The line must contain the&nbsp;sentence  "<code>The minimum amount of money
in the piggy-bank is <var>X</var>.</code>" where <var>X</var> is the minimum
amount of money that can be achieved using coins with the given total weight.
If the weight cannot be reached exactly, print a&nbsp;line "<code>This is
impossible.</code>".   </div>
<h3 align="left">Sample Input</h3>
<div align="left">
<pre>3<br>10 110<br>2<br>1 1<br>30 50<br>10 110<br>2<br>1 1<br>50 30<br>1 6<br>2<br>10 3<br>20 4<br></pre>
</div>
<h3 align="left">Output for the Sample Input</h3>
<div align="left">
<pre>The minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank is 60.<br>The minimum amount of money in the piggy-bank is 100.<br>This is impossible.</pre>
