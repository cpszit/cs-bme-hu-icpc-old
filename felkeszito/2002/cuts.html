<h2>CUTTING RECTANGLES </h2>
    
<p>You are given a rectangle whose side lengths are integer numbers. You  
want to cut the rectangle into the smallest number of squares, whose side 
 lengths are also integer numbers. Cutting can be performed with a cutting 
 machine that can cut only from side to side across, parallel with one side 
 of the rectangle. Obtained rectangles are cut separately. </p>
    
<h3>Input Data </h3>
    
<p>The input file contains two positive integers in the first line: the  lengths
of the sides of the rectangle. Each side of the rectangle is at  least 1
and at most 100. </p>
    
<h3>Output Data </h3>
    
<p>The output file consist of one line on which your program should write 
 the number of squares resulting from an optimal cutting. </p>
    
<h3>Example </h3>
    
<pre>CUTS.IN<br><br>5 6<br><br><br><br>CUTS.OUT<br><br>5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></pre>
