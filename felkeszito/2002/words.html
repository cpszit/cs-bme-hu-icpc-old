      <h2 align="center">Play on Words</h2>
      <p align="center">(<b>file name:</b><code>words.c, words.p, words.C</code>
        ) </p>
      <p> Some of the secret doors contain a&nbsp;very interesting word puzzle.
        The team of archaeologists has to solve it to open that doors. Because there
        is no other way to open the doors, the puzzle is very important for us.
      </p>
      <p> There is a&nbsp;large number of magnetic plates on every door. Every
        plate has one word written on it. The plates must be arranged into a sequence
        in such a way that every word begins with the same letter as the previous
        word ends. For example, the word ``ac<u>m</u>'' can be followed by the word
        ``<u>m</u>otorola''. Your task is to write a computer program that will read
        the list of words and determine whether it is possible to arrange all of
        the plates in a&nbsp;sequence (according to the given rule) and consequently
        to open the door. </p>
      <h3>Input Specification</h3>
      The input consists of <var>T</var> test cases. The number of them (<var>
        T</var>) is given on the first line of the input file. Each test case begins
      with a line containing a&nbsp;single integer number <var>N</var>that indicates
      the number of plates (<var>1 &lt;= N &lt;= 100000</var>). Then exactly <var>
        N</var>lines follow, each containing a&nbsp;single word. Each word contains
      at least two and at most 1000 lowercase characters, that means only letters
      '<code>a</code>' through '<code>z</code>' will appear in the word. The same
      word may appear several times in the list.
      <h3>Output Specification</h3>
      Your program has to determine whether it is possible to arrange all the
      plates in a&nbsp;sequence such that the first letter of each word is equal
      to the last letter of the previous word. All the plates from the list must
      be used, each exactly once. The words mentioned several times must be used
      that number of times.
      <p> If there exists such an ordering of plates, your program should print
        the&nbsp;sentence "<code>Ordering is possible.</code>". Otherwise, output
        the&nbsp;sentence "<code>The door cannot be opened.</code>". </p>
      <h3>Sample Input</h3>
      <pre>3<br>2<br>acm<br>ibm<br>3<br>acm<br>malform<br>mouse<br>2<br>ok<br>ok<br></pre>
      <h3>Output for the Sample Input</h3>
      <pre>The door cannot be opened.<br>Ordering is possible.<br>The door cannot be opened.</pre>
