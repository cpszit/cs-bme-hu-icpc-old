  <a name="d2pb">Let us consider a country with N towns. A system of roads
    formed from direct connections between towns is given; all these direct connections
    are considered to have the length equal to 1. This system is called <b>even-odd</b>
    if there are two towns linked by a road of even length, as well as by a
    road of odd length. </a>
  <p> <a name="d2pb">a) Find out if the system of roads is even-odd or not.
    </a></p>

  <p> <a name="d2pb">b) If the answer for a) is negative, find one of the subsets
      X of towns which has a maximal number of elements and satisfies the following
      condition: for any two towns in X, if there is a path linking them, then its
      length is even. </a></p>

  <p> <a name="d2pb">The name of the input file is introduced from the keyboard.
      Its first line contains the value of N; the following lines contain pairs
      I,J with the meaning that the towns I and J are directly linked. </a></p>

  <p> <a name="d2pb">The value of N is at most 300. It can be assumed that every
      town can be reached from every other town. </a></p>
