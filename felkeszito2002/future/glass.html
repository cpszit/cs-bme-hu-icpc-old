<h2 align="center">Glass Beads</h2>
<p align="center">(<b>file name:</b><tt> glass.c, glass.p, glass.C</tt>)  
</p>
<p>Once upon a time there was a famous actress. As you may expect, she played 
mostly Antique Comedies most of all. All the people loved her. But she was
not interested in the crowds. Her big hobby were beads of any kind. Many
bead makers were working for her and they manufactured new necklaces and bracelets
every day. One day she called her main <i>Inspector of Bead Makers</i> (<i>
IBM</i>) and told him she wanted a very long and special necklace.  </p>
<p>The necklace should be made of glass beads of different sizes connected 
to each other but without any thread running through the beads, so that means
the beads can be disconnected at any point. The actress chose the succession
of beads she wants to have and the IBM promised to make the necklace. But
then he realized a problem. The joint between two neighbouring beads is not
very robust so it is possible that the necklace will get torn by its own
weight. The situation becomes even worse when the necklace is disjoined.
Moreover, the point of disconnection is very important. If there are small
beads at the beginning, the possibility of tearing is much higher than if
there were large beads. IBM wants to test the robustness of a necklace so
he needs a program that will be able to determine the worst possible point
of disjoining the beads.  </p>
<p>The description of the necklace is a string <var>A = a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>
2</sub> ... a<sub>m</sub></var> specifying sizes of the particular beads,
where the last character <var>a<sub>m</sub></var> is considered to precede
character <var>a<sub>1</sub></var> in circular fashion.   </p>
<p>The disjoint point <var>i</var> is said to be worse than the disjoint point
<var>j</var> if and only if the string <var>a<sub>i</sub>a<sub>i+1</sub>
... a<sub>n</sub>a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>i-1</sub></var> is lexicografically
smaller than the string <var>a<sub>j</sub>a<sub>j+1</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub>
a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>j-1</sub></var>. String <var>a<sub>1</sub>a<sub>2</sub>
 ... a<sub>n</sub></var> is lexicografically smaller than the string <var>
b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub> ... b<sub>n</sub></var> if and only if there exists
an integer <var>i, i &lt;= n</var>, so that <var>a<sub>j</sub>=b<sub>j</sub></var>
, for each <var>j, 1 &lt;= j &lt; i</var> and <var>a<sub>i</sub> &lt; b<sub>
i</sub></var>.   </p>
<h3>Input Specification</h3>
<p>The input consists of <var>N</var> cases. The first line of the input contains
only positive integer <var>N</var>. Then follow the cases.  Each case consists
of exactly one line containing necklace description. Maximal length of each
description is 10000 characters.  Each bead is represented by a lower-case
character of  the english alphabet (a--z), where <var>a &lt; b &nbsp; ...
&nbsp; z</var>.   </p>
<h3>Output Specification</h3>
<p>For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer -- number
of the bead which is the first at the worst possible disjoining, i.e.\ such 
<var>i</var>, that the string <var>A[i]</var> is lexicographically smallest 
among all the <var>n</var> possible disjoinings of a necklace. If there are 
more than one solution, print the one with the lowest <var>i</var>.   </p>
