 <a name="d2pb">Let us consider a country with N towns. A system of roads 
formed from direct connections between towns is given; all these direct connections 
are considered to have the length equal to 1. This system is called <b>even-odd</b>
  if there are two towns linked by a road of even length, as well as by a 
road of odd length. </a> 
<p> <a name="d2pb">a) Find out if the system of roads is even-odd or not.
 </a></p>
 
<p> <a name="d2pb">b) If the answer for a) is negative, find one of the subsets 
X of towns which has a maximal number of elements and satisfies the following 
condition: for any two towns in X, if there is a path linking them, then its
length is even. </a></p>
 
<p> <a name="d2pb">The name of the input file is introduced from the keyboard. 
Its first line contains the value of N; the following lines contain pairs 
I,J with the meaning that the towns I and J are directly linked. </a></p>
 
<p> <a name="d2pb">The value of N is at most 300. It can be assumed that every
town can be reached from every other town. </a></p>
